/// Convert runtime variables from a finite set of values to

/// Allows the creation of a functor (in this case
/// a function like object) that takes a runtime value from
/// set of values known at compile time and passes the value
/// as a template-argument to a function-template member
/// 'when'.
///
/// My motivation for writing this is that some problems can
/// be more easily stated using templates rather than
/// runtime c++; especially when using template
/// specialization (or as it's called at runtime, pattern
/// matching).
/// Specifically I used this pattern in a project where
/// I had to represent a run time type system with
/// conversions from those run time types to c++ types.
///
/// Declarations take the following form for non-variadic
/// functors:
///
/// ```
/// struct my_functor_t : template_switch<my_functor_t, std::string, int> {
///   typedef template_switch<my_functor_t, std::string, int> super;
///
///   // Our list of cases
///   typedef super::cases_< 24, 23, 5, 17 >::type cases;
///
///   // Optional; Custom case comparison; by default this redirects to `==`
///   constexpr bool compare(int a, int b) {
///     return a == b;
///   }
///
///   // Called when a valid case is encountered
///   template<int data> static inline std::string when() { /* ... */ }
///
///   // Optional; Called when an unknown case is encountered;
///   // raises an exception by default
///   static inline std::string otherwise(int data) { /* ... */ }
/// } call_me;
/// ```
///
/// In the example we see that we can basically declare
/// a template switch by declaring a struct that inherits
/// from template_switch. The template_switch template
/// instance is given the return type of the function, the
/// type of each case and the subclass so it can access the
/// subclasses types and functions.
///
/// Within that struct we need to declare a list of cases
/// and a template function which will be called with the
/// translated type.
///
/// Because the entire construct is essentially a fancy way
/// of declaring a function, we usually just create a single
/// instance of it at the bottom of the struct declaration.
/// This is also the reason why all the methods are static:
/// They are not meant to carry any state.
///
/// In this example all methods are declared constexpr or
/// inline: This is done, because all those functions are
/// usually very small. In the end, template_switch is
/// frequently just an alternative way of writing
/// a switch/case statement.
///
/// @tparam SubType The subclass inheriting from
///   template_switch<...>; this must be given so the subclass'
///   members and types can be accessed.
/// @tparam ReturnType The return type of the functor. Must
///   also be the return type of when() and otherwise()
/// @tparam CaseType The type of the cases. This must be
///   a type that can be used as a non-type template
///   parameter.
///
/// ### Advanced Usage
///
/// For examples of these usages see the tests!
///
/// **otherwise:** Optionally we can also declare
/// a otherwise function, which will be called if an invalid
/// (non case) runtime value was given. That function is
/// also given the `data` parameter, but still as a runtime
/// value.  If no otherwise function is declared, a built in
/// one will be used which raises an error.
///
/// **additional parameters:** Supported out of the box:
/// Just add the parameters to when() and otherwise() and
/// call the functor with the added parameters.  Take care
/// that otherwise() and when() have the same signatures
/// (except the first data parameter) if otherwise is used.
/// Else the behaviour is undefined.
///
/// **overloading:** Function overloading is easily
/// supported: Just add the additional signatures and it
/// should work.
/// The behaviour is undefined if otherwise() is overwritten
/// and provides a different set of overloads.
///
/// **variadic parameters:** Variadic parameters are also
/// supported: Just add a `static const bool variadic = true;`
/// to your struct declaration and let when and optionally
/// otherwise take the additional variadic parameters by
/// adding `typename... Args` to the template parameters and
/// `Args.. args` to the runtime parameters.
/// The behaviour is undefined if when(), otherwise() and
/// variadic=true are not consistently set.
/// Mixing fixed and variadic parameters is not supported.
///
/// **stateful functors:** Our functors are really struct
/// instances â€“ objects. However they are only functions so
/// the call `()` operator can be overloaded and since
/// when(), otherwise() and compare() can not be used we
/// can not make use of any state in the functions.
/// If you still want to carry some state in the functions,
/// you could still overwrite the call operator and insert
/// a reference to the object as a parameter. Thus at least
/// when() and otherwise() could gain access to the state.
///
/// **generic programming:** Like any struct, the child can
/// of course be a template too. E.g. it could take the list
/// of cases from extern. Or the type of the return value,
/// or a template to be instantiated with the template
/// parameter given to when...
/// Also each template_switch instances provide case_type
/// and return_type as typedefs, which can be used in stead
/// of explicitly writing down those types.
///
/// ## How it works, internally
///
/// Of course, you can not really translate runtime values
/// to compile time constants; instead think of this as
/// a switch statement, where each cases contains a call to the
/// appropriate instantiation of the `template<...> ::when(...)`
/// and else just contains a call to `::otherwise(...)`.
///
/// But I lied to you again: Of course this is not really
/// based on a switch statement, because switch statements
/// only work on a fixed number of cases (fixed as in "you
/// need to write each case down manually"), so this does
/// not work.
/// Instead, internally template_switch iterates recursively
/// over each case calling compare to check whether we have
/// the correct case and finally calling otherwise() if we
/// didn't find anything.
///
/// This seems not very efficient, but since the list of
/// cases is known completely at compile time, the compiler
/// can actually very efficiently optimize this: In the best
/// case the compiler would recognize that this is another
/// form of case statement.
///
/// Looking at the assembler code this generates, gcc and clang
/// seem to do very good jobs at optimizing this at
/// optimization levels other than O1 and O0: For
/// compile-time constant input values, the entire
/// template_switch is resolved at compile time and no
/// comparison needs to be done at runtime.
/// For runtime values (those which can not possibly be
/// known at compile time) a series of if/if else statements
/// is generated.
///
/// No tests have been done to compare how similarly this
/// behaves to equivalent case statements.
